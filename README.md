Bot to get connections faster in LinkedIn, I recommend use Tapermonkey or Greasemonkey

The bot uses localStorage to save the links of the profiles and the current positition, in order to store the links, you need to put the URLs in a command like this:
    
    localStorage.counter = 0;
    
    localStorage.links = 'alejandro-garcia-83b3b4141,anotherone';

Note that instead use https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-garcia-83b3b4141 I put 'alejandro-garcia-83b3b4141', to save space and store more links. The links are separate by comma without spaces.
